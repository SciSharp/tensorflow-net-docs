# Constant

In TensorFlow, a constant is a special Tensor that cannot be modified while the graph is running. Like in a linear model `y = ax + b`, constant `b` can be represented as a `Constant` Tensor. Since the constant is a Tensor, it also has all the data characteristics of Tensor, including:

* value: scalar value or constant list matching the data type defined in TensorFlow;
* dtype: data type;
* shape: dimensions;
* name: constant's name;



## How to create a Constant

TensorFlow provides a handy function to create a Constant. In TF.NET, you can use the same function name `tf.constant` to create it. TF.NET takes the same name as python binding for the API. Naming, although this will make developers who are used to C# naming convention feel uncomfortable, but after careful consideration, I decided to give up the C# convention naming method. One of reason is for model developer, they don't have to learn a totally new different APIs.

Initialize a scalar constant:

```csharp
var c1 = tf.constant(3); // int
var c2 = tf.constant(1.0f); // float
var c3 = tf.constant(2.0); // double
var c4 = tf.constant("Big Tree"); // string
```

Initialize a constant through ndarray:

TF.NET used to work with `Numsharp`, which is a C# binding of `Numpy`. In the current version, however, TF.NET put the `NDArray` and many other numpy features inside the TF.NET, you can import `using Tensorflow.NumPy` to create an `NDArray`.

```csharp
// dtype=int, shape=(2, 3)
var nd = np.array(new int[,]
{
	{1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6}
});
var tensor = tf.constant(nd);
```

## Dive in Constant

Now let's explore how `constant` works in `eager` mode inside the black box.

Let's continue using the last examples, we're going to initialize a tensor in an ndarray of `[shape(2, 3), int32]`.

### NDArray

The first thing we need to know is about `ndarray`'s memory model. The ndarray memory model is a very important data structure, and almost all underlying computation are inseparable from this datb a structure. One fundamental aspect of the ndarray is that an array is seen as a "chunk" of memory starting at some location. The interpretation of this memory depends on the stride information. A segment of memory is inherently 1-dimensional, and there are many different schemes for arranging the items of an N-dimensional array in a 1-dimensional block. `ndarray` objects can accommodate any strided indexing scheme. In a strided scheme, the N-dimensional index <img src="_images\constant\n-index-formula.svg"/> corresponds to the offset (in bytes) : <img src="_images\constant\n-index-formula-offset.svg" />.

If we take a look at the real memory allocation in Visual Studio, below diagram helps us understand the data structure more intuitively. The strides keep track the size of every single dimension, help identify the actual offset in heap memory. The formula to calculate offset is: `offset = i * strides[0] + j * strides[1]`. 

For example: if you want to seek the value in `[1, 1]`, you just need to calculate `1 * 3 + 1 * 1 = 4`, converted to pointer is `0x000002556B194260 + 4 = 0x000002556B194264` where has a value `05`.

Through the above diagram, we know how the data is stored in memory, and then we will look at how the data is transferred to `TensorFlow`.

### Tensor

If you don't understand very well what `Tensor` is, you can go back to the chapter `Tensor` there is pretty much explanation if you skipped that chapter. Tensor is actually an NDArray that is with more than 2 dimensions.

TensorFlow will decide whether to copy the data or use the same pointer. Normally speaking, it's more safe whenever you copy data for the following process, especially in interoperating between .NET runtime and C++ runtime that they all have their own garbage collection (GC) mechanism, application will crash if someone access a block of destroyed memory. `TF_STRING` and `TF_RESOURCE` tensors have a different representation in `TF_Tensor` than they do in `tensorflow::Tensor`. Other types have the same representation, so copy only if it is safe to do so.

Before tensorflow is creating the `TF_Tensor`, it checks the shape and data size. If the size doesn't match, it will return `nullptr` pointer.

### Get the data of Tensor

For `eager` mode, it's pretty simple to view the actual value in a `tensor`.

```csharp
var data = tensor.numpy()
```

The `data` will be a `ndarray` variable.
